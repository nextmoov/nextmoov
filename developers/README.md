# For Developers

We made it clear [already](/nextmoov): we want to use the best tools only along with some strong coding conventions to smooth our collaboration.

As of today (20190416 ‚òÄ), here is a list of the MUST and SHOULD tools we use:

*   All our private codebases are stored in GitHub so you'll definitely get your own access to it. As soon as the first line of code is written, all our projects must use Git and they must be pushed to GitHub. They must be pushed at least every Friday at 09:59 as the full completion of tasks assigned to that week for you will only be judged upon code pushed online.

*   Our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes, managed by Rancher and is hosted on servers provided by DigitalOcean.  \

*   We warmly recommend you VSCode as IDE and, in any case, find a way to lint your code according to our standards (see next).

Feeling ok with theses general principles? Nice!

- [New Project](./NewProject.md) : Learn how to start a new project.\
It's as simple as clicking a Use this Template button üòç

- [Conventions](./Conventions.md) : Dive in our conventions.\
There is a lot of them, but they will greatly simplify your day-to-day job. You'll see!

- [Code Review](./CodeReview.md) : Check how to organise your work using our PR-based code-reviewing process
